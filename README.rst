* contrib/fuel_mirror
  It is a command line utility that provides the same functionality
  and user interface as deprecated fuel-createmirror. It provides
  two major features:
  * clone/build mirror (full or partial)
  * update repository configuration in nailgun
  First one is a matter of packetary while second one should be left
  totally up to fuelclient. So this module is to be deprecated soon
  in favor of packetary and fuelclient.

  WARNING: It is not designed to be used on 'live' repositories
  that are available to clients during synchronization. That means
  repositories will be inconsistent during the update. Please use these
  scripts in conjunction with snapshots, on inactive repos, etc.

Only rsync mirrors are supported.
